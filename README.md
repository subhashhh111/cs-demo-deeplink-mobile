# Ionic Customer Success Deep Linking Demo

This application demonstrates the basics of using the [Deeplinks](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-plugin-deeplinks) plugin along with the [Deeplinks Ionic Native Wrapper](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/deeplinks/).

The deep link looks like this: https://cs-demo-deeplink.herokuapp.com/oolong. Any of the tea categories on that web page should deep link into the application itself. Here is a full set of the links:

[White](https://cs-demo-deeplink.herokuapp.com/white)
[Yellow](https://cs-demo-deeplink.herokuapp.com/yellow)
[Green](https://cs-demo-deeplink.herokuapp.com/green)
[Oolong](https://cs-demo-deeplink.herokuapp.com/oolong)
[Black](https://cs-demo-deeplink.herokuapp.com/black)
[Dark](https://cs-demo-deeplink.herokuapp.com/dark)
[Puer](https://cs-demo-deeplink.herokuapp.com/puer)
[Herbal](https://cs-demo-deeplink.herokuapp.com/herbal)

## Android

The deep linking should work out of the box on most Android devices though it does not include the full [Android App Links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/#web-assoc) setup.

## iOS

This demo does not currently work on iOS. Some more configuration is required as documented in the following two articles:
